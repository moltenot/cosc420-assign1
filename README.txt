there is a file that breaks my preprocessing by the name

    39_1_20170116174525125.jpg.chip.jpg

I had to delete it
the code I copied from https://colab.research.google.com/github/shubham0204/Google_Colab_Notebooks/blob/main/Gender_Estimation_(W2).ipynb#scrollTo=tj0md65mfR5_
could not cope with this format, since it breaks the UTKFace
convention

use clean_data.py to remove these files
